Hi, I'm Alice (she/they) :rainbow_flag:

:heart: :
- Music (punk rock)
- Video and board games
- Art
- Programming
 
Recently graduated as a computational/theoretical physicist with a specialisation 
in theoretical quantum computing and algorithms from Leiden University. Currently looking for a job that combines my love for programming with the mathematical skills my
degree taught me; preferably in game dev/computer graphics.
